# Introduction

The purpose of this data project is to give you an opportunity to apply the principles and methods introduced in the QM lecture, and also some of the concepts from the Epi Research Design lecture, to real-world data. The data we will use come from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) study, described below. During the project, you task will be to answer the questions given below by familiarizing yourself with the dataset (which is also summarized below), performing statistical analyses appropriate to the question at hand, and interpreting the results of these analyses. To complete the project, you need to hand in a report describing your analyses and interpretations by **December 23th of 2022**.


# About the NHANES study

The NHANES study is an ongoing program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. Every year, a new sample of the resident non-institutionalized US population is interviewed and examined. Data are collected on a wide range of topics, such as demographics, occupation, medical diagnoses, self-rated health, nutrition, substance use, environmental exposures, or blood parameters. The data are used, among other things, to determine the prevalence of major diseases and risk factors, to design health promotion campaigns, and to establish national reference values (e.g. for height, weight, blood pressure). You can find more information on the NHANES website:

Comment:

The sampling procedure of the NHANES surveys is very complex. It is a four-stage stratified probability cluster sample. That is, instead of a simple random sample of the entire US population (for which one would require a central register of all citizens and their addresses), the researchers first randomly sampled a number of districts, within which they sampled neighborhoods, within which they sampled households, within which they finally sampled single study participants. Also, they intentionally sampled a larger number of participants belonging to certain subgroups (such as ethnic minorities), which would otherwise be too small to allow meaningful analyses. These survey design features affect representativity and precision of statistical estimates derived from the data, and complex statistical procedures would be required to fully account for this. However, our data project is about getting familiar with fundamental statistical techniques, not learning advanced methods, so we will just pretend to have an ordinary simple random sample representative of the US population.

NHANES data are released by the CDC to the general public in biannual cycles as datasets containing the data of the previous two survey years. Our dataset is based on the 2011-12 cycle. The NHANES general public releases can be downloaded by anyone, without prior registration, from their webpage (the data are stored in SAS XPORT format). If you are interested, you can for example take a look at the original 2011-12 data, the variable descriptions, and the questionnaires here:

[https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2011](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2011)

Of course, all data are to be used for the purpose of statistical analysis only, not for the purpose of identifying specific individuals. Any such effort would constitute a breach of confidentiality and is prohibited (see [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/restrictions.htm](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/restrictions.htm)). This also applies to the dataset we will be using in the data project.


# The data set

The dataset used for the data project is not identical to the NHANES 2011-12 dataset. In fact, there are several sub-datasets in NHANES containing different variables about different topics (e.g. nutrition, drug use). The data project dataset is already put together as a selection of variables from these subsets. It also contains some new variables which are derived from the original NHANES variables, for example by combining the values of several variables. 

The table below gives you an overview of the variables contained in our dataset. The variable name is used to refer to the variable in R. The variable label describes what is measured by the variable. For categorical variables, value labels are provided which explain the meaning of the variable values. "Data type" tells you what kind of values the variable can take ("boolean" means that the variable is a binary "True-False" variable; note that for these variables you can infer the meaning of the values from the wording of the variable label, which is always a question). For those of you who want to look into the original data: If the variable corresponds directly to a NHANES variable, the corresponding NHANES name is given in the last column. You can find the original dataset by entering the variable name in this search interface and choosing the appropriate data release cycle: [http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/default.aspx](http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/default.aspx). "Derived" means that the variable is calculated from NHANES variables in a more complex way.

# Data project questions

1. Familiarize yourself with the NHANES study design and the variables in the dataset by reading the sections "About the NHANES study" and "The data set" of this document. Use the information provided to answer the following questions: 

    a) What are important characteristics of the NHANES study (study design, target population, study objectives, study period, ...)? 

    b) What general categories (such as "demographics", "lab results") can the variables in the dataset be sorted into? 

2. Using the subsample you have chosen, describe the US population with regards to 

    a) Demographic characteristics. How can the strange age distribution be explained? To deal with this problem, recode the age variable into the following categories:18-34, 35-49, 50-64, 65-79, 80 or higher

    b) When asked about Marital status, some of the participants refused to answer while some didn't know which category they belonged. Hence they were coded differently. Take that into account and recode the variable martlst.

    c) Self-rated health. Looking at the results of your descriptive analysis, what do you have to consider when interpreting the results? 

3. Diabetes and ethnicity

    a) How is the diabetes status distributed in your data set? Summarize the 2 diabetes groups in a single group and recode the variable for diabetes status into two groups: non-diabetes and diabetes. Give an interval estimate for diabetes in your data set.

    b) Work with the recoded variable. Use an appropriate statistical test to test the relation between diabetes status and ethnicity. Inteprete the results of the test. 

4. Weekly working hours and self-evaluated health status

    a) The variable `hrsworked_prvwk` codes the number of weekly working hours. 77777 or 99999 are missing values. Recode these missing values with a proper value, e.g. NA.
  
    b) Recode the variable `hrsworked_prvwk` into categories [,40), [40,) weekly working hours. Number or name the categories properly. (Hint: Set the new variable as a factor variable, if necessary)
  
    c) Plot weekly working hours against selft-evaluated health status using mosaic plot. Looking at the plot, what would you tell about the relation between these two variables.
  
    d) Use an appropriate statistical test to test for the statistical significance of this relation. Inteprete the results of the test.
  
5. Blood mercury level (umol/L) and gender

    a) Describe and plot the distribution of blood mercury level in men and women.
  
    b) Use both parametric and non-parametric statistical tests to test for the statistical significance the relation between blood mercury level and gender. Inteprete the results of the tests.
  
6. BMI and HDL 

    a) How strong is the relationship between BMI and HDL (the "good" cholesterol)? Is it significant? 	How much of the variation in HDL can be explained (in a statistical sense) by variation in BMI?

    b) Does the relationship between HDL and BMI change when you adjust for age (categorized)? Interpret the coefficients of the resulting model (when you mean-center BMI before fitting the model, you can also interpret the intercept). Would you say that BMI has a clinically	relevant impact on HDL, according to your model? 

    c) Try to find a better model to predict HDL by including more covariates. Select a number of candidate covariates which in your opinion may be related to HDL, and then choose a model selection strategy and a criterion/test for comparing models. Describe the model with the best fit according to your search, and interpret the	model coefficients.
	
7. Cancer

    a) Estimate the lifetime prevalence of cancer. Can you also give an interval estimate?

    b) What are the prevalence estimates in those who were exposed to pollutants at work for a longer time period, and in those who weren’t? Is there a significant difference in prevalence between these two subgroups?
  
    c) Adjust for age in the relationship between lifetime diagnosis of cancer and exposure to pollutants, using the categorized age variable (Note: No information on pollutant exposure was collected from participants aged 80+, so these cannot be included in the analysis). Does the adjustment for age change the picture? Interpret the model coefficients including the intercept.

    d) Try to find a good model of cancer diagnosis, describe, and interpret it, as you did for HDL.
